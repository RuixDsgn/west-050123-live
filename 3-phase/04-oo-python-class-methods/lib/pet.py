# Class Attributes and Methods 

""" 
    Warm Up Questions!

    1. What is `self`?
        - self referential variable
            - What am I? 
    chauncy = Pet(args_for_chauncy)
        => self in the __init__ => newly created instance
    chauncy.print_pet_details()
        => self in this method => the instance that we are calling the method on

    2. How can you define a default attribute for a class?
        - def __init(self, default_att="Hi")
 """

""" 
    ! Class Variables and Class Methods!

    What are Class methods?
    - Methods that are called ON the WHOLE CLASS
    - Pet.count_all_pet()

    What are Instance methods?
    - relative to this specific instance
    - a method that is callled on the instance
    - instance.instance_method()
